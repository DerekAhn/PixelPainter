# PIXELPAINTER

## DESIGN NOTES
I. What classes are Needed?
	1. canvas grid class 
		- determines the size of the grid and it's cells.
	2. color palette class
		- a secondary grid with a 1/3 of the size as the canvas
		- color of the border of the cells
	3. toolbar class
		- determines functions of the buttons
		- and the actions between the color palette
	4. pixel class
		- builds the properties of each cell which inherits from canvas grid
		- color of the borders of the cells

II. What data do they hold?
	1. The canvas grid will have
		- this.length
		- this.width
		- this.size(pixel)
		- border size/color
	2. The color palette
		- this.length
		- this.width
		- this.size
		- buttons/draggable (colors from to canvas)
	3. The toolbar class
		- reset button
		- clear button(canvas)
		- undo (button)
	4. Pixel class
		- this.size X(by) this.size
		- border size and color

III. What actions do they perform?
	1. canvas grid will have a cell constructor for the grid
	2. color palette will either be buttons/draggable
	3. toolbar will have a button constructor to reset color
		- clear button to erase the whole canvas
		- undo button to undo recent color

1. create a "grid" class that takes in the arguments Length, Width, and Size.
	- Length determeines the x-axis of the grid.
	- width determines the y-axis of the gird.
	- size will determine the size of the square cell.
2 create a constructor utilizing the grid class properties.
	- Then creating a method that will utilize grid class properties.
	- utilizing two loops to generate the grid frame.
		- first for loop determining the x axis.
				- each loop creates a div element.
			- second loop determing the y axis.
				- each loop creates a div element.
- create a second constructor utilizing the grid class property s.
